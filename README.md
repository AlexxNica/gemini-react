# gemini-react

[gemini](https://github.com/gemini-testing/gemini) plugin for simplifying visual
regression testing on React + webpack stack.

**WARNING**: Right now plugin is pretty much at the proof-of-concept stage, do
not use in production.

## Configuring

1. Install plugin using `npm`:

   ```
   npm install https://github.com/researchgate/gemini-react
   ```

2. Enable it in your gemini config file:

```yaml
system:
  plugins:
    react:
      webpackConfig: <PATH>
      hostname: <HOST NAME>
      port: <PORT NUMBER>
```

### Options

* `webpackConfig` (required) â€“ path to your webpack config. Plugin will use
  loaders from this file to build test pages.
* `hostname` (default: 127.0.0.1) - hostname to run reference test server on.
* `port` (default: 5432) - port to run test server on.
* `staticRoot` - directory, which contains your static asset files. Will be
mounted by your test server automatically.
* `cssFiles` - list of CSS files to include in every test page. Requires
  `staticRoot` option to be set.

## Writing the tests

Use `geminiReact` variable instead of `gemini` and `render(<ReactComponent />)`
instead of `setUrl` and `setCaptureElements`. The rest is the same as vanilla
`gemini`:

```jsx
const MyComponent = require('./path/to/my/component');
geminiReact.suite('my react test', suite => {
    suite.render(<MyComponent prop="value" />)
        .capture('initial');
});
```

**TIP**: To use JSX in your tests, you might need [gemini-babel](https://github.com/researchgate/gemini-babel) plugin.

You don't need to create the reference pages or run the server, plugin will do
everything for you.

If you want to interact with rendered component, use `this.renderedComponent`
inside your test:

```javascript
suite.capture('clicked', function(actions) {
    actions.click(this.renderedComponent);
});
```

If you have any test-specific stylesheets, you can include them into the test
page by calling `suite.includeCss`:

```javscript
suite.includeCss('/my-component.css');
```
